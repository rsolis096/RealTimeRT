# Real Time Ray Tracer

This is a real time adaptation of the ray tracer discussed in [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) made using C++ and OpenGL.

Supported Features:

- Real-time ray depth and sample count modifcation via a simple Dear ImGUI user interface
- 3D, first person camera controls and keyboard movement
- Currently, only spheres can be rendered with either glass, metal, or diffuse materials.

This is an ongoing project and does not currently support acceleration data structures. Requires a modern dedicated graphics card to run at an adequate frame rate.
